# node-osrm

Routing engine for OpenStreetMap data implementing high-performance algorithms for shortest paths in road networks.

Provides bindings to the [Open Source Routing Machine - OSRM](https://github.com/DennisOSRM/Project-OSRM).

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/DennisOSRM/node-osrm.png)](https://travis-ci.org/DennisOSRM/node-osrm)

# Depends

 - Node.js v0.10.x or v0.8.x
 - Modern C++ runtime libraries supporting C++11

C++11 capable platforms include:

  - Mac OS X >= 10.7
  - Ubuntu Linux >= 14.04 or other Linux distributions with g++ >= 4.8 toolchain (>= GLIBC_2.17 from libc and >= GLIBCXX_3.4.17 from libstdc++)

An installation error like below indicates your system does not have a modern enough g++ toolchain:

```
Error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.17' not found (required by /node_modules/osrm/lib/binding/osrm.node)
```

If you are running Ubuntu older than 14.04 you can easily upgrade your g++ toolchain like:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++-4.8
```


# Installing

By default, binaries are provided for:

 - 64 bit OS X and 64 bit Linux
 - Node v0.8.x and v0.10.x

On those platforms no external dependencies are needed.

Just do:

    npm install osrm

However other platforms will fall back to a source compile: see [Source Build](#source-build) for details.

# Usage

See the `example/server.js` and `test/osrm.test.js` for examples of using OSRM through this Node.js API.

# Setup

The `node-osrm` module consumes data processed by OSRM core.

This repository contains a Makefile that does this automatically:

- Downloads an OSM extract
- Runs `osrm-extract` and `osrm-prepare`
- Has a OSRM config (ini) file that references the prepared data

Just run:

    make berlin-latest.osrm.hsgr

Once that is done then you can calculate routes in Javascript like:

```js
// Note: to require osrm locally do:
// require('./lib/osrm.js')
var OSRM = require('osrm')
var osrm = new OSRM("berlin-latest.osrm");

osrm.locate([52.4224,13.333086], function (err, result) {
  console.log(result);
  // Output: {"status":0,"mapped_coordinate":[52.422442,13.332101]}
});

osrm.nearest([52.4224, 13.333086], function (err, result) {
  console.log(result);
  // Output: {"status":0,"mapped_coordinate":[52.422590,13.333838],"name":"Mariannenstraße"}
});

var query = {coordinates: [[52.519930,13.438640], [52.513191,13.415852]]};
osrm.route(query, function (err, result) {
  console.log(result);
  /* Output:
    { status: 0,
      status_message: 'Found route between points',
      route_geometry: '{~pdcBmjfsXsBrD{KhS}DvHyApCcf@l}@kg@z|@_MbX|GjHdXh^fm@dr@~\\l_@pFhF|GjCfeAbTdh@fFqRp}DoEn\\cHzR{FjLgCnFuBlG{AlHaAjJa@hLXtGnCnKtCnFxCfCvEl@lHBzA}@vIoFzCs@|CcAnEQ~NhHnf@zUpm@rc@d]zVrTnTr^~]xbAnaAhSnPgJd^kExPgOzk@maAx_Ek@~BuKvd@cJz`@oAzFiAtHvKzAlBXzNvB|b@hGl@Dha@zFbGf@fBAjQ_AxEbA`HxBtPpFpa@rO_Cv_B_ZlD}LlBGB',

# Source Build

To build from source you will need:

 - OSRM `develop` branch, cloned from github.
 - OSRM build with `-DWITH_TOOLS=1` so that `libOSRM` is created
 - Lua, luabind, and stxxl headers

### Building

To build the bindings you need to first build and **install** the `develop` branch of `Project-OSRM`:

    # grab develop branch
    git clone -b develop https://github.com/DennisOSRM/Project-OSRM.git
    cd Project-OSRM
    mkdir build;
    cd build;
    cmake ../ -DWITH_TOOLS=1
    make
    sudo make install

NOTE: If you hit problems building Project-OSRM see [the wiki](https://github.com/DennisOSRM/Project-OSRM/wiki/Building%20OSRM) for details.

Then build `node-osrm` against `Project-OSRM` installed in `/usr/local`:

    git clone https://github.com/DennisOSRM/node-osrm.git
    cd node-osrm
    npm install --build-from-source


# Developing

Developers of `node-osrm` should set up a [Source Build](#source-build) and after changes to the code run:

    make

Under the hood this uses [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) to compile the source code.

# Testing

Run the tests like:

    make test

# Releasing

Releasing a new version of `node-osrm` is mostly automated using travis.ci.

### Caveats

- If you create and push a new git tag Travis.ci will automatically publish both binaries and the package to the npm registry.

- Before tagging you can test publishing of just the binaries by including the keyword `[publish binary]` in your commit message. Make sure to run `node-pre-gyp unpublish` before trying publish binaries for a version that has already been published as trying to publish over an existing binary will fail.

### Steps to release

**1)** Confirm the desired OSRM branch and commit.

This is configurable via the `OSRM_BRANCH` and `OSRM_COMMIT` variables in travis.ci.

**2)** Bump node-osrm version

Update the `CHANGELOG.md` and the `package.json` version.

**3)** Check Travis.ci

Ensure Travis.ci [builds are passing](https://travis-ci.org/DennisOSRM/node-osrm) after your last commit. This is important because upstream OSRM is being pulled in and may have changed.

**4)** Tag

Tag a new release:

    git add CHANGELOG.md package.json
    git commit -m "Tagging v0.2.8"
    git tag v0.2.8

**5)** Push the tag to github:

    git push origin master v0.2.8

This will trigger travis.ci to build Ubuntu binaries and publish the entire package to the npm registry upon success. The publishing will use the s3 and npm auth credentials of @springmeyer currently - this needs to be made more configurable in the future.

**6)** Merge into the `osx` branch

    git checkout osx
    git merge v0.2.8 -m "[publish binary]"
    git push origin osx

This will build and publish OS X binaries on travis.ci. Be prepared to watch the travis run and re-start builds that fail due to timeouts (the OS X machines are underpowered).

**7)** Check published binaries

If travis builds passed for both the `master` branch and the `osx` branch then binaries should be published for both platforms.

Confirm the remote binaries are available with node-pre-gyp:

    $ ./node_modules/.bin/node-pre-gyp info --loglevel silent | grep `node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').version)"`
    osrm-v0.2.8-node-v11-darwin-x64.tar.gz
    osrm-v0.2.8-node-v11-linux-x64.tar.gz
    osrm-v0.2.8-v8-3.11-darwin-x64.tar.gz
    osrm-v0.2.8-v8-3.11-linux-x64.tar.gz

**9)** Publish node-osrm

Publish `node-osrm`

    npm publish

Dependent apps can now pull from the npm registry like:

    "dependencies": {
        "osrm": "~0.2.8"
    }

Or can still pull from the github tag like:

    "dependencies": {
        "osrm": "https://github.com/DennisOSRM/node-osrm/tarball/v0.2.8"
    }
